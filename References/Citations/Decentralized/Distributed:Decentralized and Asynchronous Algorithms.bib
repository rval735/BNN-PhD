abstract="This chapter is concerned with decentralized and asynchronous forms of the stochastic approximation algorithms, a relatively new area of research. Compared with the rapid progress and extensive literature in stochastic approximation methods, the study of parallel stochastic approximations is still in its infancy. Perhaps the first work on the subject was [14], which dealt with a very particular class of algorithms, where similar computations were done by several processors and convex combinations were taken. The general ideas of weak convergence theory were applied to a fairly broad class of realistic algorithms in [111, 112]. The general ideas presented there and in [105, 171] form the basis of this chapter. Analogously to the problems in Chapter 8, those methods can handle correlated and state dependent noise, delays in communication, and asynchronous and distributed network forms. Various examples are given in Section 1. In the basic model, there are several processors; each one is responsible for the updating of only a part of the parameter vector. There might be overlaps in that several processors contribute to the updating of the same component of the parameter. Such models were treated in [105, 171, 172]. For a similar model, the problem of finding zeros of a nonlinear function with noisy observations via parallel processing methods and with random truncation bounds was treated in [201]. An attempt to get real-time implementable procedures via pipelining (see Section 1.2) of communication and computation for algorithms with ``delayed'' observations was in [203].",

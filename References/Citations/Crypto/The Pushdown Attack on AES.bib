  abstract={We present a new idea on chosen plaintext cryptanalysis, where we can bypass some of the cipher's encryption rounds at its beginning. To illustrate this idea, we developed the pushdown attack. This attack can increase the strength of some chosen plaintext attacks. We applied the pushdown attack on AES and were able to achieve a 6-round attack that requires only 211 chosen plaintext, this reduces the chosen plaintext needed by the square attack with a factor of 221.},

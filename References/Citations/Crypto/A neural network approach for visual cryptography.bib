The authors propose a novel approach for visual cryptography using neural networks (NNs). To perform encrypting, the input to the NN is a set of gray level images, and the output is a set of binary images (shares) that fulfils the desirable access scheme. This approach is considerably different from the traditional one, and can be applied to cope with very complex access schemes.}, keywords={cryptography;neural nets;image processing;quantum computing;neural network approach;visual cryptography;cryptographic field;key management;message concealment;authorization;authentication;identification;entertainment;encrypting;NN;gray level images;binary images;access scheme;Neural networks;Cryptography;Books;Computer science;Application software;Engineering management;Authorization;Authentication;Image recognition;Target recognition}, doi={10.1109/IJCNN.2000.861518}, ISSN={1098-7576}, month={July},}

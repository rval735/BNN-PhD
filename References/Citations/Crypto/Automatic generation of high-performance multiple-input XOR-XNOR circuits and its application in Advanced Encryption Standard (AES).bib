In this paper, we present an efficient multi-input XOR circuit design based on pass-transistor logic (PTL). A synthesis algorithm is developed to efficiently generate the PTL-based multi-input XOR circuits. Both pre-layout and post-layout simulation results show that our proposed multi-input XOR design outperforms static CMOS design. The multi-input XOR circuits are also used to design the transformations in the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).}, keywords={CMOS logic circuits;cryptography;logic design;transistor-transistor logic;automatic generation;high performance multiple-input XOR/XNOR circuits;advanced encryption standard;pass transistor logic;static CMOS design;Data structures;IP networks;Lead;Boolean functions;Layout;CMOS integrated circuits;Encryption}, doi={10.1109/ISNE.2010.5669194}, ISSN={2378-8607}, month={Nov},}

abstract = "In this Letter, a novel approach of encryption based on chaotic Hopfield neural networks with time varying delay is proposed. We use the chaotic neural network to generate binary sequences which will be used for masking plaintext. The plaintext is masked by switching of chaotic neural network maps and permutation of generated binary sequences. Simulation results were given to show the feasibility and effectiveness in the proposed scheme of this Letter. As a result, chaotic cryptography becomes more practical in the secure transmission of large multi-media files over public data communication network."

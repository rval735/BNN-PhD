B. {Cousins} and K. {Rohloff} and D. {Sumorok}}, journal={IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing},  title={Designing an FPGA-Accelerated Homomorphic Encryption Co-Processor},  year={2017}, volume={5}, number={2}, pages={193-206}, abstract={In this paper we report on our advances designing and implementing an FPGA-based computation accelerator as part of a Homomorphic Encryption Processing Unit (HEPU) co-processor. This hardware accelerator technology improves the practicality of computing on encrypted data by reducing the computational bottlenecks of lattice encryption primitives that support homomorphic encryption schemes. We focus on accelerating the Chinese Remainder Transform (CRT) and inverse Chinese Remainder Transform (iCRT) for power-of-2 cyclotomic rings, but also accelerate other basic ring arithmetic such as Ring Addition, Ring Subtraction and Ring Multiplication. We instantiate this capability in a Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA that can attach to a host computer through either a PCI-Express port or Ethernet. We focus our experimental performance analysis on the NTRU-based LTV Homomorphic Encryption scheme. This is a leveled homomorphic encryption scheme, but our accelerator is compatible with other lattice-based schemes and recent improved bootstrapping designs to support arbitrary depth computation. We experimentally compare performance with a reference software implementations of the CRT and iCRT bottlenecks and when used in a practical application of encrypted string comparison.}, keywords={coprocessors;cryptography;field programmable gate arrays;local area networks;logic design;peripheral interfaces;transforms;FPGA designing;homomorphic encryption processing unit coprocessor;HEPU coprocessor;hardware accelerator;inverse Chinese remainder transform;iCRT;ring arithmetic;Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA;PCI-Express port;Ethernet;Encryption;Cathode ray tubes;Acceleration;Hardware;Field programmable gate arrays;Applied cryptography;hardware acceleration;homomorphic encryption}, doi={10.1109/TETC.2016.2619669}, ISSN={2168-6750}, month={April},}

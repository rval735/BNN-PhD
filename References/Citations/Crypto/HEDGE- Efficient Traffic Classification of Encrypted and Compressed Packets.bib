  abstract={As the size and source of network traffic increase, so does the challenge of monitoring and analyzing network traffic. Therefore, sampling algorithms are often used to alleviate these scalability issues. However, the use of high entropy data streams, through the use of either encryption or compression, further compounds the challenge as current state-of-the-art algorithms cannot accurately and efficiently differentiate between encrypted and compressed packets. In this paper, we propose a novel traffic classification method named High Entropy DistinGuishEr (HEDGE) to distinguish between compressed and encrypted traffic. HEDGE is based on the evaluation of the randomness of the data streams and can be applied to individual packets without the need to have access to the entire stream. The findings from the evaluation show that our approach outperforms current state of the art. We also make available our statistically sound dataset, based on known benchmarks, to the wider research community.},

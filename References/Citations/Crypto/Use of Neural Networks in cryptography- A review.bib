There are many cryptographic algorithms are available, but they are more complex techniques and requires more computational power. This paper gives a review of how Neural Networks contributes a help in cryptography and how neural network and cryptography together can be used for security.}, keywords={authorisation;cryptography;neural nets;neural networks;cryptography secret information;user unauthorization;complex techniques;computational power;Biological neural networks;Encryption;Watermarking;Neurons;cryptography;cryptosystem;Neural Network;key generation and management}, doi={10.1109/STARTUP.2016.7583925}, ISSN={null}, month={Feb},}

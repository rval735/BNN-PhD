abstract="In this paper, the suitability of implementing parallel homomorphic word searching on Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors is evaluated for the first time. Homomorphic encryption allows to produce a cryptogram that encrypts the result of applying some values to any function, even when the input values are encrypted and without access to the private-key. For example, it is possible to search if any word of a set of encrypted words matches a plaintext reference word and generate a new cryptogram that encrypts the amount of matches. In this paper it is shown that this operation is about 834 times faster by using a system with 4 Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors 5110P attached to an Intel Xeon CPU E5-2630 v2, when compared with an implementation on a single core of the Xeon CPU.",

abstract="At Eurocrypt 2010 van Dijk et al. described a fully homomorphic encryption scheme over the integers. The main appeal of this scheme (compared to Gentry's) is its conceptual simplicity. This simplicity comes at the expense of a public key size in {\$}{\{}{\backslash}cal {\backslash}tilde O{\}}({\backslash}lambda^{\{}10{\}}){\$}which is too large for any practical system. In this paper we reduce the public key size to {\$}{\{}{\backslash}cal {\backslash}tilde O{\}}({\backslash}lambda^{\{}7{\}}){\$}by encrypting with a quadratic form in the public key elements, instead of a linear form. We prove that the scheme remains semantically secure, based on a stronger variant of the approximate-GCD problem, already considered by van Dijk et al.",

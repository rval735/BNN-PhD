One of the greatest challenges is how to speed up the model training process and reduce the development cost. To address the issue, this paper exploits FPGAs to accelerate NN training. Experimental results demonstrate that the model training time can be reduced by up to 99.1%, compared to the traditional software implementation.}, keywords={cost reduction;field programmable gate arrays;learning (artificial intelligence);microwave devices;FPGA-based acceleration;neural network training;microwave device modeling;model training process;development cost reduction;Training;Field programmable gate arrays;Artificial neural networks;Software;Random access memory;Hardware;neural network;quasi-Newton method;FPGA;hardware acceleration}, doi={10.1109/NEMO.2016.7561676}, ISSN={}, month={July},}

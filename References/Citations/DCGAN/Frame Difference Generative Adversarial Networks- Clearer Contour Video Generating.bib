  abstract={Generating image and video is a hot topic in Deep Learning. Especially, generating video is a difficult but meaningful work. How to generate video which has diversity and plausibility is still a problem to be solved. In this paper, we propose a novel model of Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) which called FDGAN to generate clear contour lines. Unlike existing GAN that only use frames, our method extends to use inter-frame difference. First introduce two temporal difference methods to process the inter-frame. Then increase a frame difference discriminator to discriminate whether the inter-frame is true or not. Using the model and new structure proposed, we perform video generation experiments on several widely used benchmark datasets such as MOVING MNIST, UCF-101. Consequently, the results achieve state-of-the-art performance for clarifying contour lines. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations were made to show the effectiveness of our methods.},

However, few algorithms were shown to be able to work under those circumstances. Here, Novelty-Organizing Team of Classifiers (NOTC) is applied to the continuous action mountain car as well as two variations of it: a noisy mountain car and an unstable weather mountain car. These problems take respectively noise and change of problem dynamics into account. Moreover, NOTC is compared with NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) in these problems, revealing a trade-off between the approaches. While NOTC achieves the best performance in all of the problems, NEAT needs less trials to converge. It is demonstrated that NOTC achieves better performance because of its division of the input space (creating easier problems). Unfortunately, this division of input space also requires a bit of time to bootstrap.}, keywords={neural nets;pattern classification;statistical analysis;dynamic environments;noisy environments;novelty-organizing team of classifiers;NOTC;noisy mountain car;continuous action mountain car;unstable weather mountain car;neuroevolution of augmenting topologies;NEAT;bootstrap;Sociology;Statistics;Arrays;Noise;Meteorology;Noise measurement}, doi={10.1109/CEC.2015.7257254}, ISSN={1089-778X}, month={May},}

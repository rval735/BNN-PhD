abstract="We discuss the parallel implementation of Genetic Algorithms and Evolution Strategy on General-Purpose Graphical Units, using the OpenCL framework. Multiple evolutionary operators are tested (tournament, roulette wheel selection, uniform and Gaussian mutation, crossover, recombination), as well as different approaches for parallelism, for small and large problem sizes. We use the Island Model of Parallel GA, with random migration. Performance is measured using two graphic cards: NVidia GeForce GTX 560Ti and AMD Radeon 6950. Tests are performed in a distributed grid, using the Java Parallel Processing Framework.",

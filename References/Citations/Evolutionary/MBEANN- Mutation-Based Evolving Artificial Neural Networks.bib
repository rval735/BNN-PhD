abstract="A novel approach to topology and weight evolving artificial neural networks (TWEANNs) is presented. Compared with previous TWEANNs, this method has two major characteristics. First, a set of genetic operations may be designed without recombination because it often generates an offspring whose fitness value is considerably worse than its parents. Instead, two topological mutations whose effect on fitness value is assumed to be nearly neutral are provided in the genetic operations set. Second, a new encoding technique is introduced to define a string as a set of substrings called operons. To examine our approach, computer simulations were conducted using the standard reinforcement learning problem known as the double pole balancing without velocity information. The results obtained were compared with NEAT results, which is recognised as one of the most powerful techniques in TWEANNs. It was found that our proposed approach yields competitive results, especially when the problem is difficult.",

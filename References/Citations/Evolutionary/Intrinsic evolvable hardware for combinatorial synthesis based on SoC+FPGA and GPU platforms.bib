abstract = "This paper presents a novel a parallel genetic programming (PGP) Boolean synthesis implementation on a low cost cluster of an embedded open platform called SIE. Some tasks of the PGP have been accelerated through a hardware coprocessor called FCU, that allows to evaluate individuals onchip as intrinsic evolution. Results have been compared with GPU and HPC implementations, resulting in speedup values up to approximately 2 and 180 respectively.",

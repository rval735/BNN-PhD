It offers the unique possibility of certifiably secure data transmission among users at different remote locations. Cryptography is used to achieve availability, privacy and integrity over different networks. Usually, there are two categories of cryptography i.e. symmetric and asymmetric. In this paper, we have proposed a new symmetric key algorithm based on genetic algorithm (GA) and error back propagation neural network (EBP-NN). Genetic algorithm has been used for encryption and neural network has been used for decryption process. Consequently, this paper proposes an easy cryptographic secure algorithm for communication over the public computer networks.}, keywords={backpropagation;computer network security;cryptography;genetic algorithms;neural nets;symmetric key cryptography;data hiding;information hiding;unauthorized access;certifiably secure data transmission;remote locations;data integrity;data privacy;genetic algorithm;error back propagation neural network;EBP-NN;GA;decryption process;cryptographic secure algorithm;public computer networks;Neurons;Genetic algorithms;Encryption;Artificial neural networks;Receivers;cryptography;error back propagation neural network;genetic algorithm;symmetric key}, doi={}, ISSN={}, month={March},}

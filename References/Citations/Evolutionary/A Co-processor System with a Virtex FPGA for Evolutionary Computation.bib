abstract="In this paper, we show that a co-processor system with a Virtex FPGA can achieve high performance in evolutionary computations by utilizing the two features of the FPGA. First, agents in evolutionary computation models which are usually expressed using short bit-strings can be stored in distributed select RAMs of Virtex FPGAs very efficiently. Second, the partial reconfiguration and readback functions of the FPGAs make it possible to exploit more parallelism without thinking about circuits for data I/O. The preliminary results of a model base on Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma showed that the system can achieve high performance because of the two features.",

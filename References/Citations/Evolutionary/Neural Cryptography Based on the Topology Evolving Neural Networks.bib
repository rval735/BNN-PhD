Recently works show a new direction about cryptography based on the neural networks. Instead of learning a specific algorithm, a cryptographic scheme is generated automatically. While one kind of neural network is used to achieve the scheme, the idea of the neural cryptography can be realized by other neural network architecture is unknown. In this paper, we make use of this property to create neural cryptography scheme on a new topology evolving neural network architecture called Spectrum-diverse unified neuroevolution architecture. First, experiments are conducted to verify that Spectrum-diverse unified neuroevolution architecture is able to achieve automatic encryption and decryption. Subsequently, we do experiments to achieve the neural symmetric cryptosystem by using adversarial training.}, keywords={cryptography;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;topology evolving neural networks;neural network architecture;neural cryptography scheme;neural symmetric cryptosystem;mathematical theory;spectrum-diverse unified neuroevolution architecture;automatic encryption;automatic decryption;adversarial training;Neurons;Encryption;Biological neural networks;Network topology;Topology;Neural cryptography, Symmetric cryptosystem, Spectrum-diverse unified neuroevolution architecture, Topology evolving neural networks}, doi={10.1109/CANDARW.2018.00091}, ISSN={}, month={Nov},}

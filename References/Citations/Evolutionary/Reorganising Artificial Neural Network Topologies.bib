abstract="This chapter describes a novel way of complexifying artificial neural networks through topological reorganisation. The neural networks are reorganised to optimise their neural complexity, which is a measure of the information-theoretic complexity of the network. Complexification of neural networks here happens through rearranging connections, i.e. removing one or more connections and placing them elsewhere. The results verify that a structural reorganisation can help to increase the probability of discovering a neural network capable of adequately solving complex tasks. The networks and the methodology proposed are tested in a simulation of a mobile robot racing around a track.",

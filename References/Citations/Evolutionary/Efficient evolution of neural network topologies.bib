An important question in neuroevolution is how to gain an advantage from evolving neural network topologies along with weights. We present a method, NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) that outperforms the best fixed-topology methods on a challenging benchmark reinforcement learning task. We claim that the increased efficiency is due to (1) employing a principled method of crossover of different topologies, (2) protecting structural innovation using speciation, and (3) incrementally growing from minimal structure. We test this claim through a series of ablation studies that demonstrate that each component is necessary to the system as a whole and to each other. What results is significantly faster learning. NEAT is also an important contribution to GAs because it shows how it is possible for evolution to both optimize and complexify solutions simultaneously, making it possible to evolve increasingly complex solutions over time, thereby strengthening the analogy with biological evolution.}, keywords={learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;genetic algorithms;neural network topologies;neuroevolution;evolving artificial neural networks;genetic algorithms;reinforcement learning;hidden state information;neuroevolution of augmenting topologies;fixed-topology methods;ablation studies;Neural networks;Network topology;Evolution (biology);Artificial neural networks;Learning;Genetic algorithms;Benchmark testing;Protection;Technological innovation;System testing}, doi={10.1109/CEC.2002.1004508}, ISSN={null}, month={May},}

This paper proposes MSCryptoNet, a novel framework that enables scalable execution and the conversion of state-of-the-art learned neural network to MSCryptoNet models in the privacy-preservation setting.We also design a method for approximation of the activation function basically used in convolutional neural network (CNN) (i.e. Sigmoid, Rectified linear unit (ReLU) etc.) with low degree polynomials which is vital for computations in homomorphic encryption schemes. Our model seems to target the following scenarios: (1) The practical way to enforce the evaluation of classifier whose inputs are encrypted with possibly different encryption schemes or even different keys whiles securing all operations including intermediate results. (2) The minimization of communication and computational cost of Data Providers. MSCryptoNet is based on multi-scheme fully homomorphic encryption (MS-FHE). We also prove that MSCryptoNet as a privacy-preserving deep learning scheme over the aggregated encrypted data are secured.}, keywords={Cryptography;Neural networks;Training;Cloud computing;Deep learning;Computational modeling;Data models;Internet of Things;Privacy-preserving;Fully Homomorphic Encryption}, doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2901219}, ISSN={2169-3536}, month={},}

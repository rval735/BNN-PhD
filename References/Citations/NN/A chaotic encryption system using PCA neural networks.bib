The PCA neural network can produce the chaotic behaviors under certain conditions so that it serves as a pseudo-random number generator to generate random private keys. In this encryption system, the one-time pad encryption method is used, which is regarded as the most secure encryption method. The proposed system can encrypt any kind of data. The security and high performance of encryption are illustrated via some simulations.}, keywords={chaotic communication;neural nets;principal component analysis;private key cryptography;random number generation;chaotic encryption system;PCA neural networks;principal component analysis;pseudo-random number generator;random private keys;one-time pad encryption method;Chaos;Cryptography;Principal component analysis;Neural networks;Information security;Random number generation;Computational intelligence;Laboratories;Computer science;Paper technology;Principal Component Analysis;Neural Networks;Chaotic Encryption;Information Security}, doi={10.1109/ICCIS.2008.4670938}, ISSN={2326-8123}, month={Sep.},}

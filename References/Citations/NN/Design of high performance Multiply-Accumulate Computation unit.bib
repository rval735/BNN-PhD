Multiplier is one of the most important block in MAC unit. The overall performance of the MAC unit depends on the resources used by the multiplier. Therefore, this paper describes the design of a Partial Product Reduction Block (PPRB) that is used in the implementation of multiplier having better area, delay and power performances. PPRB reduces the partial products row wise by using different multi-bit adder blocks instead of conventional coloumn wise reduction. MAC unit consisting of the multiplier realized using the proposed partial product reduction technique has a delay reduction of 46%, power consumption is reduced by 39% and area requirement is reduced by 17% when compared to MAC unit realised using conventional multiplier architecture.}, keywords={digital signal processing chips;logic design;multiplying circuits;high-performance multiply-accumulate computation unit design;digital signal processing;DSP;MAC unit;partial-product reduction block;PPRB;multiplier implementation;multibit adder blocks;delay reduction;power consumption reduction;area requirement reduction;Adders;Delays;Digital signal processing;Computer architecture;Computers;Consumer electronics;Carry-lookahead adder;brent-kung adder;wallace tree;booth multiplier;multiply-accumulate unit}, doi={10.1109/IADCC.2015.7154838}, ISSN={}, month={June},}

    abstract = {The normalized cross-correlation (NCC), usually its 2D version, is routinely encountered in template matching algorithms, such as in facial recognition, motion-tracking, registration in medical imaging, etc. Its rapid computation becomes critical in time sensitive applications. Here I develop a scheme for the computation of NCC by fast Fourier transform that can favorably compare for speed efficiency with other existing techniques and may outperform some of them given an appropriate search scenario.},

abstract="Cryptanalysis of a cryptographic function usually requires advanced cryptanalytical skills and extensive amount of human labor with an option of using randomness testing suites like STS NIST [1] or Dieharder [2]. These can be applied to test statistical properties of cryptographic function outputs. We propose a more open approach based on software circuit that acts as a testing function automatically evolved by a stochastic optimization algorithm. Information leaked during cryptographic function evaluation is used to find a distinguisher [4] of outputs produced by 25 candidate algorithms for eStream and SHA-3 competition from truly random sequences. We obtained similar results (with some exceptions) as those produced by STS NIST and Dieharder tests w.r.t. the number of rounds of the inspected algorithm.",

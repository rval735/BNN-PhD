R. {Rezai}}, journal={IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering},  title={Addressing Neurological Disorders With Neuromodulation},  year={2011}, volume={58}, number={7}, pages={1907-1917}, abstract={Neurological disorders are becoming increasingly common in developed countries as a result of the aging population. In spite of medications, these disorders can result in progressive loss of function as well as chronic physical, cognitive, and emotional disability that ultimately places enormous emotional and economic on the patient, caretakers, and the society in general. Neuromodulation is emerging as a therapeutic option in these patients. Neuromodulation is a field, which involves implantable devices that allow for the reversible adjustable application of electrical, chemical, or biological agents to the central or peripheral nervous system with the objective of altering its functioning with the objective of achieving a therapeutic or clinically beneficial effect. It is a rapidly evolving field that brings together many different specialties in the fields of medicine, materials science, computer science and technology, biomedical, and neural engineering as well as the surgical or interventional specialties. It has multiple current and emerging indications, and an enormous potential for growth. The main challenges before it are in the need for effective collaboration between engineers, basic scientists, and clinicians to develop innovations that address specific problems resulting in new devices and clinical applications.}, keywords={biochemistry;bioelectric phenomena;brain;cognition;electrochemistry;macromolecules;medical disorders;molecular biophysics;neuromuscular stimulation;prosthetics;neurological disorders;neuromodulation;emotional disability;aging population;chronic physical disability;patient therapy;implantable devices;reversible adjustable application;electrical agents;chemical agents;biological agents;central nervous system;peripheral nervous system;clinical applications;electrical stimulation;cognitive disability;Neuromuscular;Aging;Medical services;Neuromodulation;Gerontology;Neuromodulation;neurological disorders;Adult;Biomedical Engineering;Deep Brain Stimulation;Electric Stimulation Therapy;Electric Stimulation Therapy;Electrodes, Implanted;Female;Humans;Infusion Pumps, Implantable;Male;Nerve Net;Nervous System Diseases;Neurosciences;Vagus Nerve Stimulation}, doi={10.1109/TBME.2010.2102758}, ISSN={0018-9294}, month={July},}

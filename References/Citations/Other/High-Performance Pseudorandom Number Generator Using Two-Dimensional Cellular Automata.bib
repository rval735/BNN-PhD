High-quality PRNG can be constructed by employing cellular automata (CA). Advantage of the PRNG that employs CA includes that it is fast and suitable for hardware implementation. In this paper, we propose a two-dimensional (2-D) CA based PRNG. Our scheme uses the structure of programmable CA (PCA) for improving randomness quality. The CA rules used our PRNG are additive rules which has XOR and XNOR logic with a hybrid dependency, only rules 15, 31, 47 and 63. Moreover, for minimising of auto correlations among the produced pseudorandom number blocks, a novel time spacing technique is proposed without a loss of an original cycle length. Finally, we provide experimental results to verify the randomness quality using ENT and DIEHARD test suites.}, keywords={cellular automata;random number generation;high-performance pseudorandom number generator;two-dimensional programmable cellular automata;PRNG;randomness quality;additive rules;XOR logic;XNOR logic;time spacing technique;Application software;Computer simulation;Computer industry;Cryptography;Hardware;Two dimensional displays;Principal component analysis;Logic;Autocorrelation;Testing}, doi={10.1109/DELTA.2008.46}, ISSN={null}, month={Jan},}

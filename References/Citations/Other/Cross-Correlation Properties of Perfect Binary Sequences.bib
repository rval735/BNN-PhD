abstract="Binary sequences with good autocorrelation properties are widely used in cryptography. If the autocorrelation properties are optimum, then the sequences are called perfect. In the last few years, new constructions for perfect sequences have been found. In this paper we investigate the cross-correlation properties between perfect sequences. We give a lower bound for the maximum cross-correlation coefficient between arbitrary perfect sequences. We conjecture that this bound is not best possible. Furthermore, we determine perfect sequences with provable good correlation properties.",

abstract="Randomness testing plays an important role in cryptography. Randomness is typically examined by batteries of statistical tests. One of the most frequently used test batteries is the NIST Statistical Test Suite. The tests of randomness should be rather fast since they usually process large volumes of data. Unfortunately, this is not the case for the NIST STS, where a complete test can take hours. Alternative implementations do exist, but are not very efficient either or they do not focus on the most time-consuming tests. We reimplemented all NIST STS tests and achieved interesting speedups in most of the tests, including the tests with the highest time complexity. Overall, our implementation runs 30 times faster than the original code.",

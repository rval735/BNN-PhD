abstract="The GCA (Global Cellular Automata) model consists of a collection of cells which change their states synchronously depending on the states of their neighbors like in the classical CA (Cellular Automata) model. In differentiation to the CA model the neighbors are not fixed and local, they are variable and global. The GCA model is applicable to a wide range of parallel algorithms. In this paper a general purpose multiprocessor architecture for the massively parallel GCA model is presented. In contrast to a special purpose implementation of a GCA algorithm the multiprocessor system allows the implementation in a flexible way through programming. The architecture mainly consists of a set of processors (Nios II) and a network. The Nios II features a general-purpose RISC CPU architecture designed to address a wide range of applications. The network is a well-known omega network. Only read-accesses through the network are necessary in the GCA model leading to a simplified structure. A system with up to 32 processors was implemented as a prototype on an FPGA. The analysis and implementation results have shown that the performance of the system scales with the number of processors.",

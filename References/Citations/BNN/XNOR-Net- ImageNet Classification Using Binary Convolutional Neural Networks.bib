abstract="We propose two efficient approximations to standard convolutional neural networks: Binary-Weight-Networks and XNOR-Networks. In Binary-Weight-Networks, the filters are approximated with binary values resulting in 32{\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}{\texttimes}memory saving. In XNOR-Networks, both the filters and the input to convolutional layers are binary. XNOR-Networks approximate convolutions using primarily binary operations. This results in 58{\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}{\texttimes}faster convolutional operations (in terms of number of the high precision operations) and 32{\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}{\texttimes}memory savings. XNOR-Nets offer the possibility of running state-of-the-art networks on CPUs (rather than GPUs) in real-time. Our binary networks are simple, accurate, efficient, and work on challenging visual tasks. We evaluate our approach on the ImageNet classification task. The classification accuracy with a Binary-Weight-Network version of AlexNet is the same as the full-precision AlexNet. We compare our method with recent network binarization methods, BinaryConnect and BinaryNets, and outperform these methods by large margins on ImageNet, more than {\$}{\$}16{\backslash},{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}16{\%}inÂ top-1 accuracy.

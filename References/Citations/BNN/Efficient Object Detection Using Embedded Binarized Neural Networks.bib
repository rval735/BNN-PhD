abstract="Memory performance is a key bottleneck for deep learning systems. Binarization of both activations and weights is one promising approach that can best scale to realize the highest energy efficient system using the lowest possible precision. In this paper, we utilize and analyze the binarized neural network in doing human detection on infrared images. Our results show comparable algorithmic performance of binarized versus 32bit floating-point networks, with the added benefit of greatly simplified computation and reduced memory overhead. In addition, we present a system architecture designed specifically for computation using binary representation that achieves at least 4{\texttimes} speedup and the energy is improved by three orders of magnitude over GPU.",

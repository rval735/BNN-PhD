While the competition has seen plenty of interest, it has so far focused on online planning, providing a forward model that allows the use of algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search. In this paper, we describe how we interface GVGAI to the OpenAI Gym environment, a widely used way of connecting agents to reinforcement learning problems. Using this interface, we characterize how widely used implementations of several deep reinforcement learning algorithms fare on a number of GVGAI games. We further analyze the results to provide a first indication of the relative difficulty of these games relative to each other, and relative to those in the Arcade Learning Environment under similar conditions.}, keywords={computer games;learning (artificial intelligence);Monte Carlo methods;planning (artificial intelligence);tree searching;AI algorithms;domain-specific description language;Monte Carlo Tree Search;reinforcement learning problems;deep reinforcement learning algorithms;GVGAI games;Arcade Learning Environment;General Video Game AI;associated software framework;online planning;GVGAI interface;OpenAI Gym environment;Games;Benchmark testing;Machine learning;Planning;Learning (artificial intelligence);deep reinforcement learning;general video game AI;video game description language;OpenAI Gym;advantage actor critic;deep Q-learning}, doi={10.1109/CIG.2018.8490422}, ISSN={2325-4289}, month={Aug},}

Notes:
- Just few BiSUNA image pairs were included in folder "RawData" in order to comply with the 350MB limit
- Code does not require any special libraries, only a g++/clang compiler
- BiSUNA-CPAFull.pdf is the original paper plus the appendix with extra information that could not be included in the main submission
- It is possible to parallelize agent execution, just change setting "ThreadNumber" inside "BiSUNAConf.ini" to match the number of processors the test computer has
- An additional zip file was added, "NIST-results.zip", which has results from the NIST-STS, "fast". Using their online testing tool, a small sample of the files used
here were submitted to their service, the output is included in the zip file. Unfortunately because of time, these could not be included in the full paper.

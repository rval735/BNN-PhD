Notes:
- Just few BiSUNA image pairs were included in folder "RawData" in order to comply with the 50MB limit
- Code does not require any special libraries, only a g++ compiler
- BiSUNA-CPAFull.pdf is the original paper plus the appendix with extra information that could not be included in the main submission
- It is possible to parallelize agent execution, just change setting "ThreadNumber" inside "BiSUNAConf.ini" to match the number of processors the test computer has
